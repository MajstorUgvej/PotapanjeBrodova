# Battleship game

A battleship board game I created as a school project. When the game starts, the player is presented with the rules, then chooses between three difficulty levels (easy, normal, and hard). The player can also choose whether to place the ships manually or have them placed automatically in a random pattern. The player and the program take turns targeting each other’s ships, and the winner is the one who first destroys the opponent’s fleet.

## Running the Program

All code is contained in the main.cpp file. Simply download main.cpp and run it in any C++ compiler.
